# stuff-squared
52 apps 52 weeks. 

it is quite simple - every week i will conceptualize/design/develop/launch a new app (of all sorts: mobile, web, SMS, etc.) and launch a subsquent blog post documenting the process. 

motivations: 

- i've recently come to a realization that we (humans) spend way too much thinking about problem-solution, when in reality we should be putting our heads down, and moving the world forward through tangible, iterative progress. ideas do not need to be perfect, and you don't need to be an expert in anything in order to build real solutions. 

- im relatively new to the world of programming (~ 2 years), so this will be an effective way for me to get my hands dirty, and fortify my skillset, while further understanding the process by which i can try to effect real change (however big or small) in the world. 

- i like building stuff and putting it out in the world.
